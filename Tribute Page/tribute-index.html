        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918–2013) was a South African anti-apartheid activist,
        political leader, and philanthropist who served as the first democratically elected
        President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He spent 27 years in prison for his
        resistance to apartheid, and upon release, became a unifying figure in the fight for
        racial equality and reconciliation. His leadership, humility, and vision inspired the
        world and continue to influence movements for justice and freedom today.

      <p>
        Mandela received over 250 honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, and is
        remembered globally as a champion of human rights.
